# TACS_effects_single_neurons



These folders contain the data set for of 25 neocortical cells with various dynamics (each folder is independent of each other). Here, we investigated the effects of tACS amplitudes on computational models of single neocortical neurons. 

## Information about the neocortical cells used
A set of 25 neocortical cells was modified and used in this investigation and can be downloaded from ModelDB (click on this link https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/default accession number: 066023 or directly click on this link https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel?model=241165#tabs-1). 
This model already contains .hoc files necessary to run the model and additional and/or modified .hoc files can be found in the NEURON_code folder.
Further information about the cell dynamics can be found in [aberra2018biophysically].

## Software requirements 
The data were generated using NEURON environement 7.8.1  You can download this software here https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/. A supercomputer was used, however, depending on the length of simulation, it is possible to use a regular desktop or laptop. For the analysis of the data, a custom matlab code was used. You can download this software here https://www.mathworks.com.


## Data analysis
NB: due to the large amount of data, the files for all neurons are not available on github. All the files required for the analysis are however available.
Data were analyzed with a custom Matlab code.
